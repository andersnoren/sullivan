# Sullivan

Sullivan is a WordPress theme built with WooCommerce powered stores in mind, but it works just as well for regular business websites or blogs. It features a beautiful design with custom styling for all WooCommerce pages and features, Block Editor support, a search field displaying instant results, dropdown modals for both My Account and the basket in the header, full-width slideshows the blog and the store page, a slideshow for posts set to the gallery post format, custom widgets, social menus, and much more.

## Contributing
Do you have a bug report or feature request? Feel free to create an issue, and I’ll take a look at it. You can also create a pull request if you have a solution ready. 

Keep in mind that I maintain my themes in my spare time. Even though I deeply appreciate any and all contributions, I can’t guarantee I’ll take a look at them quickly.
