== Installation ==

1. Upload the theme
2. Activate the theme

If you want to use the slideshow functionality, you also need to install and activate the Sullivan Compatibility Plugin. It's available for free on the WordPress.org plugin directory, or through the Plugins page in the WordPress dashboard.


== Slideshows ==

1. Install and activate the Sullivan Compatibility Plugin, if you haven't already.
2. Click Slideshows > Add New in the admin menu.
3. Fill in the fields, select a post thumbnail and select which of the slideshow locations you want the slide to be displayed in. The shop location is only visible if you have WooCommerce installed.
4. Save the slide.

The slide will now be displayed in the slideshow location you selected.


== Full Width Page Template ==

1. Create a new page, or edit an existing one.
2. Click the dropdown beneath "Template" in "Page Attributes", and select Full Width Template.


== Add a Post Gallery ==

1. Create a new post, or edit an existing one.
2. In the right hand column, in the box titled "Format", select "Gallery".
3. Select the very first line of the content of your post (either in the Visual Editor och the Text Editor â€“ which one doesn't matter).
4. Click the button labeled "Add Media", directly above the content box.
5. In the lefthand panel navigation, click on "Create Gallery".
6. Select the images you want to include in your slideshow. Add captions if you want to display a descriptive text along with each slide.
7. When you have selected the images you want to include, click the "Create a new gallery" button in the lower right corner of the window.
8. Finally, click the "Insert gallery" button in the same corner of the window.
9. Publish the post. As long as you leave the gallery as the first element in your content, it will be displayed in place of the featured image for that post (and won't be displayed at the start of the post itself).
